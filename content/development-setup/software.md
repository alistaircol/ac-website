A comprehensive, but totally non-exhaustive list of applications I use.

## Desktop applications

Obviously I use browsers (various), chat applications (teams can get to ü§¨), etc. some others include:

* [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
  * I have the [all products pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/), I mostly just use [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
  * TODO: I want to make global settings to add PHP servers, add debug run configuration, etc. and remove some 'clutter' from the UI into a `dotfiles` repo
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  * I only use this sparingly when I want to make some minor changes without the bloat that comes with PhpStorm or VS Code
  * TODO: I should add some of my opinionated settings into a `dotfiles` repo
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * I only use this sparingly
* [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/)
  * A nice PHP REPL which is nice for some prototyping/debugging
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
  * HTTP things
* [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)
  * I use this almost daily for note-taking and splitting tasks into achievable checklists
* [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
  * For the rare occasion I pretend to be a hacker

### Mac

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Macs Fan Control](https://crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control)
  * Because Apple would rather have their laptops run at insane temperatures instead of spin the fan
* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
  * A better experience than default terminal
* [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
  * My preferred terminal, I found it to be glitchy sometimes thought YMMV
* [magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/)
  * Gives you keyboard shortcuts to move and resize windows by keyboard shortcuts ‚ù§Ô∏è
* [amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/)
  * Amethyst acts as a tiling window manager ‚ù§Ô∏è
* [Pixel Picker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixel-picker-image-color-picker/id930804327)/[ColorSlurp](https://colorslurp.com/)
  * Easily grab the colour value of a pixel
* [Responsively](https://responsively.app/)/[Helo](https://usehelo.com/)
  * Debugging email UI

## CLI applications

* git
* jq
* yq
* aws-cli
* newt/whiptail

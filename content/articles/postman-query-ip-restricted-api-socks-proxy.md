**Rationale** Had an IP to debug, but it is only allowed from server IP addresses.

Unfortunately Postman doesn't support SOCKS proxy, so have to find something else. No problem.

**Start SOCKS proxy**

```bash
ssh -D 7777 -fCqN -I ~/.ssh/id_rsa my-host
```

* `-D`: The bind address.
* `-f`: Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
* `-C`: Requests compression of all data.
* `-q`: Quiet mode.
* `-N`: Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports.
* `-I`:  Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user authentication.
* `~/ssh/id_rsa`: Public key to use
* `my-host`: Entry in `~/.ssh/config`'s `Host`

**Start HTTP to SOCKS proxy**

Install:

```bash
npm install -g http-proxy-to-socks
```

Run the proxy:

```bash
hpts -s 127.0.0.1:7777 -p 7788
```

Set up Postman to use the HTTP proxy.

File → Settings → Proxy → Add a Custom Proxy Configuration

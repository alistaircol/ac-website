I'm a full-stack developer with leanings towards Laravel (TALL); as well as devops and automation. Most of these articles are published as a reference for myself, but if someone finds them useful, then great!

You can see the list of articles below, the [tags](/tags); or use the search function below to see more.

Some things I want to learn and write about (even if it's just for myself) in the future:

* **misc** OAuth server and client
* **misc**: ansible and other server maintenance things, i.e. `motd` and `unattended-upgrades`.
* **docker/k8s**: [rancher](https://rancher.com), [heimdall](https://heimdall.site), [helm](https://helm.sh/)
* **misc**: [ceph](https://ceph.io/), [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [grafana](https://grafana.com/), [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [dozzle](https://dozzle.dev), proxies, more..

You can see [tags](/tags) for what topics I like to cover.

Some things I want to learn and write about (even if it's just for myself) in the future:

* **misc** OAuth server and client
* **misc**: ansible and other server maintenance things, i.e. `motd` and `unattended-upgrades`.
* **docker/k8s**: [rancher](https://rancher.com), [heimdall](https://heimdall.site), [helm](https://helm.sh/)
* **misc**: [ceph](https://ceph.io/), [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [grafana](https://grafana.com/), [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [dozzle](https://dozzle.dev), proxies, more.. 
* **traefik** TLS and cnames for most things - http services work great ATM but TCP/UDP not so much. *wip*

**Rationale**: A major application is quite old and is *very* database heavy in its testing, and is unfeasible for it to be changed.
This has made the testing of this application quite cumbersome - involving a script to pull the structure of all tables,
and certain other data tables (where it's too tricky for it to be a static fixture data file) prior to running the test suite. Extracting this data to `sqlite` database too is a
possibility but might cause different issues.

The framework has a [plugin](https://github.com/lorenzo/cakephp-fixturize) which can load [fixture](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.3/fixtures.html) data from a database table, which is ideal for the applications use-case.

The framework does all its testing in a schema called `testing`.
 
The test cases `setUpBeforeClass` will behind-the-scenes copy any structure from fixtures (from the `testing_fixtures` schema) and populate from `testing_fixtures` if configured, else from a csv, or no data.

A script, possibly something like [this](https://gist.github.com/alistaircol/7dac533f056cec38cd19b2571a52e4a0) which will use `mysqldump` to dump structure of schemas, and certain tables data for import later. This will create an output file, `crm.sql`.

This whole process of building the `crm.sql` file and the `docker image` might be best done inside a lambda/serverless part of infrastructure where the database is being hosted, but that's too out of scope for this humble tutorial.

---

Building the new image with the structure is pretty easy once this file has been generated.

The `Dockerfile` could look something like below.

`DockerfileDbCi`:

```dockerfile {hl_lines=[4,5,6,7]}
FROM mysql:5.7
COPY crm.sql /tmp/crm.sql
RUN touch /tmp/crm-header.sql \
 && echo 'create schema if not exists testing;' > /tmp/crm-header.sql \
 && echo 'create schema if not exists testing_fixtures;' > /tmp/crm-header.sql \
 && echo 'use testing_fixtures;' >> /tmp/crm-header.sql \
 && cat /tmp/crm-header.sql /tmp/crm.sql > /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/crm.sql
```

* `testing` is `drop`ped and `create`d in the frameworks testing runner
* `testing_fixtures` is pretty much a read-only holding area, the frameworks testing runner will use this as a reference for structure and data for each test case 
* `use testing_fixtures;` since the dump script doesn't have any awareness of that

I found this [answer](https://serverfault.com/a/915845/530593) helpful for loading the `crm.sql` into the image.

## Building the image

Don't do this.

```bash
docker build -f DockerfileDbCi -t alistaircol/db-ci .
```

Multiple tags are allowed, might want to tag with date as well as latest, since this makes sense to be run daily, or even more frequently.

```bash
docker build -f DockerfileDbCi \
    -t alistaircol/db-ci:$(date '+%Y-%m-%d') \
    -t alistaircol/db-ci:latest \
    .
```

You can see they have been built.

```bash
docker images -a alistaircol/db-ci --format "{{.ID}}: {{.Repository}} {{.Tag}}"
```

```text
81cc0956594b: alistaircol/db-ci 2020-12-08
81cc0956594b: alistaircol/db-ci latest
```

## Testing the image

Testing the image contains fixture data, etc.:

```bash
docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -a -q --filter name=db_ci) 2>/dev/null
docker run --rm -p 3333:3306 --name db_ci -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password alistaircol/db-ci:latest
```

Open Datagrip or MySQL workbench, etc. for a quick sanity check to see the schema structure.

## Creating a repository in registry for the image

The easiest way I think without messing with alternative registries is to publish onto [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com), where most things are.

You will need to create an account for this, and you are allowed one private repository. You only need to follow these steps once.

![repos](/img/articles/docker-db-ci/01-dockerhub-repos.png)

Click `Create Repository`.

![new repo](/img/articles/docker-db-ci/02-new-repo.png)

Fill out the repository name, i.e. the image name and optionally the description. Then click `Create`.

![view new repo](/img/articles/docker-db-ci/03-view-empty-repo.png)

You're now almost ready to push your built image to the registry.

## Publishing the image

First you will need to authenticate yourself prior to `docker push`.

This simple command will ask for your password (this is the same one you use to login to dockerhub account) interactively, see `man docker-login` if you do not want this to be interactive.

```bash
docker login --username=alistaircol

Password: 
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/ally/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
Login Succeeded
```

Now we will be able to push.

```bash
docker push alistaircol/db-ci
```

It might take some time.

![view new repo](/img/articles/docker-db-ci/04-docker-push.png)

The image with its tags will be pushed, so no need to push twice with as many tags as you had to build.

![view new repo](/img/articles/docker-db-ci/05-dockerhub-tags.png)

Where you are building the image where it's not ephemeral, I would recommend running the following command prior to build and push steps outlined above:

```bash
docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -a -q --filter name=db_ci) 2>/dev/null
```

## Pulling the private image

If you're on the same host that built and pushed the image, it's easy enough to pull it down, we're already authenticated from the earlier `docker login`.

This won't work when pulling down in a CI pipeline from bitbucket pipeline, github actions, etc. though.

The process will be similar. Authenticate with the username and password for dockerhub, using the secret manager for those platforms CI pipeline.

### Bitbucket

[`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-docker-images-as-build-environments/) example:

You can use [secure variables](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/variables-in-pipelines-794502608.html) to configure username and password variables, then add them to the image YAML configuration as shown below:

```yaml
image:
  name: alistaircol/db-ci:latest
  username: $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME
  password: $DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD
  email: $DOCKER_HUB_EMAIL
```

### Github

Github Action will be very similar, see example from Github [blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-09-24-github-actions-private-registry-support-for-job-and-service-containers/).

### Gitlab

Again this should be very similar, documentation [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html#define-an-image-from-a-private-container-registry)

I don't have any authority or claim to be any sort of expert on this, it's more of a reference to myself, but if it's helpful to more than just myself, then great (dopamine stonks).

{{< alert "warning" >}}CS308: Building Software Systems{{< /alert >}}

Type: {{< color "warning" >}}Software Construction{{< /color >}}

Assignments: ([Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/yQdXa))

* Java: Directed graph implementation and breadth-first search - Boston metro system
* Java: Stock folio tracker
* Java: Pinball simulator with edit mode and solid physics

Application takes a directed graph in the form of a text file and this application constructs the directed graph and finds the shortest path between two points.

This application allows folios of shares to be bought and sold, tracks changes and loss/gain.

Gizmoball, this pinball simulator has an edit and run mode, you can add gizmos/bumpers to the game board and the ball(s) will go crazy! Application has correct and commended for its customisable physics.

Assignments:

* Java: Add type checking and interpretation layers to create an interactive calculator that can accept our custom designed language as input, and either report a syntax error, or else a correctly-formed program and report its [denotational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics). Also had to produce a detailed report of additions and how the project was approached.

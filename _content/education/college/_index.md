I joined Kilmarnock College (now Ayrshire College) in 2011 to study Computing (specialising in Software Development) to a high enough level to gain entry to university.


This involved two steps:

* HNC: Higher National Certificate (pre-requisite for HND)
* HND: Higher National Diploma (pre-requisite for BSc)

I passed both steps with distinction.

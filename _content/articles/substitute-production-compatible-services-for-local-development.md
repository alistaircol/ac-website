For local development there are a few services we might want to mock. I'll walk through substituting some common services.

There are a few reasons you might want to do this:

* You don't have the relevant credentials
* You don't want to risk some the work you're doing on local environment ever going out to the live services

TL;DR:

* `docker-compose.yml` [gist](https://gist.github.com/alistaircol/145aad8877a80184e8497802037afcd5)
* `minio-terraform` [gist](https://gist.github.com/alistaircol/b7bff7690d629e3fb69905b8b177b87a)
* `graylog-terraform` [gist](https://gist.github.com/alistaircol/bfbf6a04e9e58857037c0efda77ef87e)

## Mailhog

This is a really neat [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/). But basically (with the app configured correctly) any smtp mail sent from it will go into the mailbox provided by mailhog - regardless of the recipients addresses. 

Alternatively you could use [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io) if you don't want to run this locally.

Laravel sail also comes with mailhog, so that might be an option for you.

`docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: '3.4'
services:
  mailhog:
    image: mailhog/mailhog:latest
    ports:
    - 1025:1025
    - 8025:8025
```

Configure your app to use 1025 (default smtp port), and you can go to 8025 in your browser to see the mailbox.

![Mailhog: empty inbox](/img/articles/local-dev-laravel-complements/mailhog-empty-inbox.png)

### Integrating Mailhog into Laravel App

Laravel config:

`.env`:

```diff
 MAIL_MAILER=smtp
-MAIL_HOST=mailhog
+MAIL_HOST=0.0.0.0
 MAIL_PORT=1025
 MAIL_USERNAME=null
 MAIL_PASSWORD=null
 MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
 MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=null
 MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

Make a Mailable in Laravel:

```shell
php artisan make:mail --force --markdown=mail.mailhog-markdown MailhogMarkdownMail
```

Will create:

* `app/Mail/MailhogMarkdownMail.php`
* `resources/view/mail/mailhog-markdown.blade.php`

Make a Command to send the email:

```shell
php artisan make:command MailTest
```

`app/Console/MailTest.php` update the `handle`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use App\Mail\MailhogMarkdownMail;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

class MailTest extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'mail:send';
    
    protected $description = 'Send an email';

    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
    
    public function handle()
    {
        $mail = (new MailhogMarkdownMail)
            ->from('app@ac93.uk')
            ->subject('Email from app');

        Mail::to('user@ac93.uk')
            ->send($mail);

        return 0;
    }
}
```

```shell
php artisan mail:send
```

Huzzah!

## Minio

[Minio](https://min.io/) is an S3 compatible provider for object storage. This could be a replacement if your app uses some S3 buckets, DO spaces, etc.

![Minio: login](/img/articles/local-dev-laravel-complements/minio-login.png)

A free access token generator to replace `minio/minio123`:

```bash
head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c16
head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c60
```

```yml
version: "3.4"
services:
  minio:
    image: minio/minio:RELEASE.2021-02-19T04-38-02Z
    container_name: minio
    ports:
    - 9999:9000
    environment:
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - MINIO_ROOT_USER=W3jV4BKyEjsnKwed
    # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=EePilp8wrzPO79MHcxRYbXuRh4OEaOA67LhJ9EQO70hkIDzDD5Igvjxwj0CT
    volumes:
    - minio:/data
    command: server /data
    
# you can remove this and provide a path if you want to easily explore on your local filesystem
volumes:
  minio:
```

Run `docker-compose up` and then we'll be able to configure a few buckets.

![Minio: no-buckets](/img/articles/local-dev-laravel-complements/minio-no-buckets.png)

The `+` icon down the bottom is very easy to follow, so I won't cover it here.

After the bucket has been created - you can start uploading through the client.

![Minio: upload](/img/articles/local-dev-laravel-complements/minio-upload.png)

### Minio Configuration with Terraform

You can skip this section if you only have one bucket to create, but this is how to use terraform to create your minio how you like, these can be shared between developers, and it takes just a minute to get up and running!

Thanks to [`aminueza/minio`](https://github.com/aminueza/terraform-provider-minio)!

`main.tf`:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    minio = {
      source  = "aminueza/minio"
      version = ">= 1.0.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

provider "minio" {
  minio_server     = var.minio_server
  minio_region     = var.minio_region
  minio_access_key = var.minio_access_key
  minio_secret_key = var.minio_secret_key
}
```

`variables.tf`:

```terraform
variable "minio_region" {
  description = "Default MINIO region"
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "minio_server" {
  description = "Default MINIO host and port"
  default     = "localhost:9000"
}

variable "minio_access_key" {
  description = "MINIO user"
  default     = "minio"
}

variable "minio_secret_key" {
  description = "MINIO secret user"
  default     = "minio123"
}
```

`buckets.tf`:

```terraform
resource "minio_s3_bucket" "ac_website" {
  bucket = "ac-website"
  acl    = "public"
}
```

`outputs.tf`:

```terraform
output "ac_website_id" {
  value = minio_s3_bucket.ac_website.id
}

output "ac_website_url" {
  value = minio_s3_bucket.ac_website.bucket_domain_name
}
```

`terraform.tfvars`:

I'm going to override the default port here, since there's going to be a conflict with graylog running on 9000.

Also I've updated the default access & secret keys.

You could easily add, for example, `default_acl` into `variables.tf` and use that in `bucket.tf` to make things more secure.

I am only using this for local development on a secure network not open to public and that's the only environment I recommend running this.

```terraform
minio_server     = "localhost:9999"
minio_access_key = "W3jV4BKyEjsnKwed"
minio_secret_key = "EePilp8wrzPO79MHcxRYbXuRh4OEaOA67LhJ9EQO70hkIDzDD5Igvjxwj0CT"
```

Make the bucket:

* Lint/format (not strictly required step)

```bash
terraform fmt
```

* Install required providers

```bash
terraform init
```

```text
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

- Installing aminueza/minio v1.2.0...
- Installed aminueza/minio v1.2.0 (self-signed, key ID 3FD1ADE55BB3D907)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

* Query the service(s) and see what needs to change

```bash
terraform plan
```

```text
$ terraform plan

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # minio_s3_bucket.ac_website will be created
  + resource "minio_s3_bucket" "ac_website" {
      + acl                = "public"
      + bucket             = "ac-website"
      + bucket_domain_name = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy      = false
      + id                 = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + ac_website_id  = (known after apply)
  + ac_website_url = (known after apply)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
```

* Create the bucket

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

```text
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
minio_s3_bucket.ac_website: Creating...
minio_s3_bucket.ac_website: Creation complete after 0s [id=ac-website]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ac_website_id = "ac-website"
ac_website_url = "http://localhost:9999/minio/ac-website"
```

Afterwards you can see the bucket has been created!

### Integrating Minio into Laravel App

Laravel `.env` changes - the region doesn't really matter in this simple example.

```dotenv {hl_lines=[6]}
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=W3jV4BKyEjsnKwed
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=EePilp8wrzPO79MHcxRYbXuRh4OEaOA67LhJ9EQO70hkIDzDD5Igvjxwj0CT
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=ac-website
AWS_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.1.6:9999
```

`AWS_ENDPOINT` is the LAN IP the minio container is running on. 

We need to install a S3 client:

```bash
league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 ~1.0
```

A test Command to upload from `stdin`:

```shell
php artisan make:command MinioUploadFromStdin
```

`app/Console/Command/MinioUploadFromStdin.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

class MinioUploadFromStdin extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'file:upload {file_name}';

    protected $description = 'Upload a file from stdin';

    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        // https://gist.github.com/sroze/3e8d45d0cdc301debfd2#gistcomment-3085650
        $readStreams   = [STDIN];
        $writeStreams  = [];
        $exceptStreams = [];
        $streamCount   = stream_select(
            $readStreams,
            $writeStreams,
            $exceptStreams,
            0
        );

        $hasStdIn = $streamCount === 1;

        if (!$hasStdIn) {
            $this->line('Pleas pass some stdin in');
            return 1;
        }

        Storage::put(
            $this->argument('file_name'),
            file_get_contents('php://stdin'),
            'public'
        );

        return 0;
    }
}
```

Usages:

```bash
# in container
echo 'blah' > file
php artisan file:upload from-sail.txt < file
```

![Minio: upload from within sail](/img/articles/local-dev-laravel-complements/minio-from-sail.png)

Alternatively upload a file from host without adding volume. Unfortunately can't add any args into `sail`

## Graylog

Alternatively you could install [`laravel/telescope`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/telescope) which has some logging functionality, but this would need to be on a per application installation and configuration which might not be ideal if you have more than one application (e.g. website, backend and API).

```yaml

### Graylog Configuration with Terraform

Not required, it's as easy as:

* Login
* System
* Inputs
* Select Input (Syslog UDP)
* Launch new input
  * Check global (docker node name might change between restarts)
  * Give a title
  * Save
  
That's pretty much it. You can make it do more, but for now that's enough for us to see logs coming in on the Search page.

### Integrating Graylog into Laravel App

This is easy - `papertrail` is already preset in `config/logging.php`.

`.env`:

```diff {hl_lines=[4]}
-LOG_CHANNEL=stack
+LOG_CHANNEL=papertrail
 LOG_LEVEL=debug
+PAPERTRAIL_URL=192.168.1.6
+PAPERTRAIL_PORT=514
```

Again, this is LAN IP of the target host.

```shell
sail@4ecb77128cca:/var/www/html$ php artisan tinker
Psy Shell v0.10.6 (PHP 8.0.1 — cli) by Justin Hileman
>>> Log::info('this is a message from tinker - should go into graylog');
=> null
>>> exit
```

You can dig into [monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/main/src/Monolog/Handler/SyslogUdpHandler.php) source and override settings such as the `application_name`, etc.

To do the above, you can set `ident`, e.g.:

`config/logging.php`:

```php
'graylog' => [
    'driver' => 'monolog',
    'level' => 'debug',
    'handler' => SyslogUdpHandler::class,
    'handler_with' => [
        'host' => env('PAPERTRAIL_URL'),
        'port' => env('PAPERTRAIL_PORT'),
        'ident' => \Illuminate\Support\Str::slug(env('APP_NAME')),
    ],
],
```

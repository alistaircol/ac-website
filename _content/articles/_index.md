Some things I want to learn and write about (even if it's just for myself) in the future:

You can see [tags](/tags) for what topics I like to cover.

* **js/sh**: very basic Google Chrome extension to list dev sites, show which branch is on there, time of last remote push, etc. *WIP*
  * Using vue which is totally overkill and has some interesting challenges.
* **php**: doxygen/sphinx documentation generation.
* **misc**: ansible and other server maintenance things, i.e. `motd` and `unattended-upgrades`.
* **git**: quick few things like tags, configs, signing commits.
* **docker/k8s**: [rancher](https://rancher.com), [heimdall](https://heimdall.site), [helm](https://helm.sh/)
* **composer** composer v2, custom packagist package.
* **misc**: [ceph](https://ceph.io/), [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [grafana](https://grafana.com/), [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [dozzle](https://dozzle.dev), proxies, more.. 
* **misc**: webdevops containers with graylog & gelf stack logging
* **nginx**: reverse https -> http proxy for local minio container for use in https development site, i.e. from `valet secure`
* **traefik** TLS and cnames for most things - http services work great ATM but TCP/UDP not so much. *wip*

Mostly the articles below are just a place to dump what I think are some pretty neat, or exotic commands for my future reference.

I work on a few different Laravel applications using the same database between them.

Only one of the applications has migrations, and the others have models linked to the singular database.

---

When I run migrations on the project containing the migration files, I have to run my script to generate the `laravel-ide-helper` files for *each* project and sometimes I may have forgotten to run this after running a migration, causing some *Argh* moments.

How do you listen to a post-migration event?

There's nothing super-easy (i.e. more than one step required) out of the box for this, but I'll show what I did.

- Make a service provider (or add to an existing provider)
- Register the service provider (if not adding to an existing provider)
- Add post-migration handler logic

## Service Provider

I'm not 100% sure whether this is the best approach, but I want to dump this information here.

It isn't absolutely necessary to create a new `Provider`, you can add to the main `AppServiceProvider`'s `boot`, but maybe having separate is better for you.

While trying to find a solution, I answered [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63194721) similar SO question, which gave me a head-start and something to look at to achieve my goal!

```bash
php artisan make:provider CommandListenerProvider
```

Will unsurprisingly generate `app/Providers/CommandListenerProvider.php`.

The `MigrationsEnded` is fired when there isn't any errors and there was something to change. So if nothing was changed, or a migration was run but failed, then it won't be fired.

May not be necessary for you, but I listen to the `CommandStarting` event too, so I can see whether it's ran with `--pretend`, then it's likely the user is debugging, so running the post-migration handler in my case will be costly and makes no real change on the database. See my SO [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63194721/laravel-intercept-multi-parameter-artisan-event/68025467#68025467) to see how I check whether it's been ran with `--seed`.

## Register the Service Provider

If you want to keep separate from the main `AppServiceProvider`'s `boot` it's really easy to add the new Provider, just add to `config/app.php`:

```diff
     /*
     |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     | Autoloaded Service Providers
     |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     |
     | The service providers listed here will be automatically loaded on the
     | request to your application. Feel free to add your own services to
     | this array to grant expanded functionality to your applications.
     |
     */
     'providers' => [
         /*
          * Laravel Framework Service Providers...
          */
         // truncated
         
         /*
          * Package Service Providers...
          */
          
         /*
          * Application Service Providers...
          */
         App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
         App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider::class,
         // App\Providers\BroadcastServiceProvider::class,
         App\Providers\EventServiceProvider::class,
         App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider::class,
+        App\Providers\CommandListenerProvider::class,
     ],
```

## Post-Migration handler

You can do whatever you want, but for me, I want to generate `laravel-ide-helper` files in my different projects.

I've implemented the `TODO: whatever you want post-migrate :)` simply to run this `post-migrate` target in the repository containing the migrations `Makefile`.

```makefile
post-migrate: website1 website2 website3

ide_helper = composer require barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper ^2.7; \
	php artisan ide-helper:meta; \
	php artisan ide-helper:generate --helpers; \
	php artisan ide-helper:eloquent; \
	php artisan ide-helper:models --nowrite; \
	git restore composer.json composer.lock

website1:
	@cd ~/development/website1; pwd; ${ide_helper}
	
website2:
	@cd ~/development/website2; pwd; ${ide_helper}
	
website3:
	@cd ~/development/website3; pwd; ${ide_helper}
```

Hope this helps!
